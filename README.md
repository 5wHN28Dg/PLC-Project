## Overview
This project aims to showcase my PLC programming skills, HMI usability, modular design, testing rigor, and agile teamwork through Simulation of a full plant, this will be a long but worthwhile journey but as always I will take it one step at a time.

## Tools used
I will be starting with Siemens PLC stack 1st as it is the dominant in the market then maybe in the future I will implement the same project using the rest...
- TIA Portal: to write, upload, debug the code
- PLCSIM Advanced: Simulating siemens simatic S7-1500
- 3D Plant simulation SW: haven't decided yet on which on to use

all of this will be running inside a windows 10 VM using docker as a backend.
