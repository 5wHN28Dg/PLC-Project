## Overview
This project aims to showcase my PLC programming skills, HMI usability, modular design, testing rigor, and agile teamwork through Simulation of a full plant, this will be a long but worthwhile journey but as always we will take it one step at a time.

## Tools used
I will be starting with siemens PLC stack 1st as it is the dominant in the market then maybe in the future I will implement the same project using the rest...
- TIA Portal STEP 7 Professional: to write, upload, and debug the code
- SIMATIC S7â€‘PLCSIM Advanced: Simulating siemens simatic S7-1500
- SIMIT Simulation Platform: for code validation and plant simulation

all of this will be running inside a windows 10 VM using docker as a backend.

## Project Scope (WIP)
Anything beyond PLC, DCS, SCADA will be ignored (maybe, we will see). The aim is to simulate a full plant but since I am just getting started and thoroughly researching on the topic, I am fully open to scale down the project scope as I find necessary.

## Installation
place holder

## Roadmap
- [ ] implement 1st process in the plant
